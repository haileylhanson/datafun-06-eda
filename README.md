 ## EDA Notebook


# Specification for Project 6 EDA Notebook

## Overview

This project is part of the Graduate-level Data Analytics Fundamentals course at Northwest Missouri State University
This project was an opportunity to create my own custom
exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using
GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

## Deliverable Names

- GitHub Repository:  **datafun-06-eda**
- Documentation:      README.md
- Notebook:           **haileyhanson_eda.ipynb**

## Coffee Shop Dataset 

The dataset is saved within the repo as coffee.csv

It is a clean dataset from Kaggle.com at the following link:

See requirements.txt for compilation instructions

## External Dependencies

This project requires at least the following external modules, so a local project virtual environment is recommended.

- jupyterlab: Enables Jupyter notebooks.
- pandas: Handles data manipulation and analysis, focusing on structured (tabular/panel) data.
- pyarrow: Required by pandas; facilitates interaction between pandas and the Arrow format.
- matplotlib: Basic tools for plotting and visualizing data.
- seaborn: Simplifies complex visualizations and statistical plots, built on matplotlib.
